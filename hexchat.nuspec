    <summary>HexChat is an IRC client based on XChat, but unlike XChat it’s completely free for both Windows and Unix-like systems.</summary>
    <description>HexChat is a fork of XChat which is free for Linux and Windows. It was originally named XChat-WDK and was created as an alternative to the Shareware version of XChat for Windows, but changed its name because it went far beyond being a simple Windows only version of XChat and efforts to merge into XChat officially hit a dead-end</description>
